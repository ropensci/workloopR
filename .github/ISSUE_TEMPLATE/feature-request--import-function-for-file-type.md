A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Does as_muscle_stim() not work?**
Although we are very happy to create new functions for additional file types, we'd like to know if our current workaround does not work for you. Please provide a description of whether `as_muscle_stim()` can work or if it fails in this use case.
